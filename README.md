## How does websack implement Caching?

Websack uses [contenthash] to implement filename substititions . The hash associsted with every file changes only when the content inside the file changes , otherwise it remains same . A changed hash in turn changes the name of the file to a new one . On the client only those files are downloaded again whose name has been changed while others get `cached`.

### In `webpack.config.js` you can see inside output object
`filename: "[name].[contenthash].bundle.js"`

This [contnethash] is responsible for implemeting caching in websack.
